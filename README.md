Week 2 Day 2 Homework for Sparta - Using CSS to develop my version of Instagram home page

Here I used my newly learned skills in html and css (which I learned this week), to give my own interpretation of the login screen. Once I completed the MVP I went away and taught myself how to use forms and buttons.

My main challenges for this project were:

-making sure that everything was in the correct place
-using an external font for the h1 tag
-generating my gradient background using the instagram colour scheme.
